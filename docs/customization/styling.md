# Styling Options

Styling is a big part of any project and if you are a small team or solo developer, it can be difficult to come up with new styling ideas.

Here's a few tools that can help spice up your project:

- [Clerk Themes](https://clerk.com/docs/components/customization/themes)
- [Shadcn UI Theme Generator](https://gradient.page/tools/shadcn-ui-theme-generator)
- [Modern Background Snippets](https://bg.ibelick.com/)

## Future Development

In the future, we plan to include different theme styles a bit like [`DaisyUi`](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

As developers, we want to focus on coding rather than designing!
