# File Structure

We can categorise the project into three sections:

- Root - the files in the root of the `project` directory
- Backend - the files in the `backend` directory
- Frontend - the files in the `frontend` directory

You'll mainly be working with the files in `backend` and `frontend` directories and likely visit the `root` files only at the start and end of the projects development.
